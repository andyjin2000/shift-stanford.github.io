To create a website for a new year, copy all the current files and folders EXCEPT for 
the past folders (i.e. the name of the folder is a year) in a new folder with the name of the 
past year.

So if you're creating the website iteration for 2019:
- Make a new folder titled 2018.
- Copy css/, img/, js/, index.html to 2018/

Now edit index.html to be up to date for the new year! At the minimum that'll require:
- Adding images for speakers in img/
- Editing index.html for a speaker with:
 - The date they are speaking
 - The path to their image
 - The link to a bio
 - The speaker name 
 - The speaker title 
 - A video if you have it 

Some of the introductory text at the top of the website will
also have to change and ideally a new link is added to point
to the previous iteration of the course's website.
